# TODO
- implement IO devices - I've just bodged in a couple to sanity check things are working, should tidy up with `Writeable` and `Readable` traits
- MIXAL assembler - because writing programs by byte value is painful
- implement a proper running loop - something like `while running { handleNextInstruction }`
